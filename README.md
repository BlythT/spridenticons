# spridenticons
An api service for generating identicon sprites.

Inspired by this [random ship generator](https://2draw.me/random_ship_generator/index.en.htm) which was inspired by [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-generative-art-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code-d37f379859f/) that generates random symetrical sprites, and the various art it has inspired on twitter due to the innate ambiguity and character in the sprites, I have decided these sprites would make a good ideniticon.

Similar things already exist, including by GitHub themselves, but as a personal project I am going to create a dockerised API service where you pass a username/piece of text (along with some other optional parameters) and get back an identicon.

In some ways the "Character" these sprites have make them more memorable, so it's easier to spot a different user with a very similar name, just by seeing their sprite.
